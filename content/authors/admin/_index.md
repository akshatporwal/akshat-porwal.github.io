      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep
      learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological
      trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully
      connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural
      networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and
      apply deep learning to your own applications.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships
      between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage
      complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing
      an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great
      day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that
      you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working
      with web APIs, and building GUIs.
