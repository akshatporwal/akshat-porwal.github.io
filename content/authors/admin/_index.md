      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships
      between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage
      complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing
      an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great
      day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that
      you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working
      with web APIs, and building GUIs.
